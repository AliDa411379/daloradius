# Final Test Instructions for Agent Deletion

## ‚úÖ What Has Been Fixed

1. **Database Structure**: Added `is_deleted` columns to both `agents` and `operators` tables
2. **Soft Delete Logic**: Changed from hard delete to soft delete (UPDATE instead of DELETE)
3. **UI Components**: Fixed delete button structure to match working examples
4. **Form Handling**: Proper POST request handling with CSRF protection
5. **JavaScript**: Confirmed `removeCheckbox` function is available and working

## üß™ How to Test

### Step 1: Access the Agents List
1. Go to: `http://localhost/daloradius/app/operators/mng-agents-list.php`
2. You should see a list of agents with checkboxes
3. You should see a "Delete" button in the controls area

### Step 2: Test the Delete Functionality
1. **Select agents**: Check one or more agent checkboxes
2. **Click Delete**: Click the "Delete" button
3. **Confirm**: You should see a JavaScript confirmation dialog
4. **Submit**: Click "OK" to confirm deletion
5. **Verify**: The page should reload and selected agents should disappear

### Step 3: Verify Database Changes
Run this SQL to check the soft delete worked:
```sql
SELECT id, name, is_deleted FROM agents WHERE is_deleted = 1;
```

### Step 4: Test Form Submission Directly
If the UI doesn't work, test the form submission directly:
1. Go to: `http://localhost/daloradius/test_agent_delete_form.php`
2. Select some agents and click "Delete Selected Agents"
3. This will test the core deletion logic

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Delete Button Doesn't Appear
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify the page loads completely
- Check if user has proper permissions

### If Delete Button Doesn't Work
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify `removeCheckbox` function is defined
- Test with the standalone test form

### If Form Submission Fails
- Check server error logs
- Verify CSRF token is being generated
- Check database connection

### If Agents Don't Disappear
- Check if `is_deleted` column exists in database
- Verify the UPDATE query is working
- Check if queries properly filter `WHERE is_deleted = 0`

## üìã Expected Behavior

1. **Before Deletion**: Agents appear in the list with checkboxes
2. **During Deletion**: JavaScript confirmation dialog appears
3. **After Deletion**: 
   - Selected agents disappear from the list
   - Success message appears
   - Database records are marked with `is_deleted = 1`
   - Associated operator accounts are also marked as deleted

## üö® If Still Not Working

If the deletion still doesn't work after following these steps:

1. **Check Error Logs**: Look in Apache/PHP error logs for any errors
2. **Test Database**: Run the test scripts to verify database operations work
3. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the user has permission to delete agents
4. **Browser Issues**: Try a different browser or clear cache
5. **JavaScript Issues**: Check browser console for JavaScript errors

The implementation is complete and should be working. The most likely issues would be:
- JavaScript not loading properly
- User permissions
- Browser caching old files
- Database connection issues

## üìÅ Files That Were Modified

All these files have been updated to support soft delete:
- `mng-agents-list.php` - Main agents list with delete functionality
- `mng-agents-del.php` - Single agent deletion
- `mng-agents-edit.php` - Agent editing (excludes deleted)
- Database schema - Added `is_deleted` columns
- Various other files to filter out deleted agents

The solution is complete and ready for testing!
